Welcome to Pour It! The goal of this minigame:
to 'pour' the right amount of hot water. You will need
to press 'D' to start pouring a random amount of water.
After every pour, the kettle will tell you how much
more water they need! Pour too much, and you'll spill!
If you spill, you will get 0 points. Otherwise, your
score is based on how close you are to the right amount.
Press 'E' to end the mini-game early.
